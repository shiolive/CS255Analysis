# CS255Analysis
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for this project was DriverPass, they wanted a system designed to assist driving students in learning and passing their driving test. They provide behind the wheel driving training and test practice for the DMV test. The system had to allow for the student to access the training, take practice tests, and schedule drivers training appointments
What did you do particularly well?
I believe that my diagrams were well displayed and my system requirements were well thought out
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would add more error handling in my use cases. I did not think of every possible error and did not plan to handle each error.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I read all requests from the user and did my best to apply them to the software needs. It is important to listen to all of the needs and implement them in the smoothest way possible for the user.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I personally prefer a more incremental approach to software design. I like to take each part in stages of gathering info, organization, planning, implementation, and testing. It helps the software come together more complete and it ensures the system will function best and most efficiently.
